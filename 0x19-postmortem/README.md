Postmortem: Debugging a Web Stack
Overview
I was tasked with debugging a web stack issue that was causing errors for users accessing my website. The issue was identified by my monitoring system, which alerted me to an increase in HTTP 500 errors. 
Root Cause
After investigating the logs, we found that the issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the web server. Specifically, the server was not properly handling requests for a certain endpoint, resulting in HTTP 500 errors. This misconfiguration was likely caused by a recent update to the web server software, which introduced a new default configuration that conflicted with our existing setup.
Resolution
To resolve the issue, we rolled back the web server software to the previous version, which had a configuration that was compatible with our setup. We also made changes to our monitoring system to alert us immediately if similar issues occur in the future.
Lessons Learned
Through this experience, I learned several valuable lessons:
Always monitor your systems: Without our monitoring system, we may not have detected this issue until it had caused significant damage to our website and reputation.
Keep configurations up to date: As new updates are released, it's important to review and update configurations to ensure they are compatible with the latest software.
Document changes: Whenever changes are made to a system, it's important to document them in detail, so that any issues can be traced back to their source quickly and easily.
Work together: I was able to resolve this issue quickly because we worked together, sharing information and expertise.


Conclusion
In conclusion, this experience was a valuable lesson in the importance of monitoring, updating configurations and documenting changes. I was able to resolve the issue quickly and with minimal impact on my users, and I am better prepared for similar issues in the future.
